🌿 Project Demo
Here is a quick look at the whimsical design and interactive elements in action, including the animated profile picture and the homepage's typing effect.
✨ Key Features
🌸 Whimsical "Storybook" Design: The entire site is presented within a container styled to look like a page from a vintage storybook, complete with a paper-textured background.
🎨 Spring Garden Theme: A consistent color palette, custom fonts, and floral imagery create a cohesive and charming "spring garden tea party" aesthetic.
🎉 Interactive Elements: Subtle animations, such as a gentle bobbing effect on the profile picture and a typing animation on the homepage title, add a layer of interactivity and fun.
📱 Responsive Layout: The design adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors, ensuring a great user experience on any device.
🚀 Deployed via GitHub Pages: The website is hosted for free and deployed directly from this repository using GitHub Pages.
